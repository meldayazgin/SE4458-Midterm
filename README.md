# SE4458-Midterm
My assignment is: Group 1 â€“ API Project for an Airline Company.
The project is provides a simple backend API for an airline system, allowing admins to manage flights and create capacity reports while helping users to search for flights, book tickets, and check in. The application uses Spring Boot for its RESTful architecture, with key components such as controllers for handling API requests, models for representing data entities (e.g., Flight, Ticket, User), and repositories for interacting with the database. Security is implemented using JWT authentication for admin endpoints, while user operations like booking and check-in are accessible without login. The API is stateless and designed for scalability, making use of JPA for database operations.

While developing the project, challenges included configuring Spring Security for JWT integration and handling specific scenarios like recurring flights and error messages.
